## Gamesave Manager

This is a simple batch script to create symlinks for game save directories.

**Please Note!** I wouldn't recommend using this!
A much more polished and complete version of this is available via [GameSave Manager](http://www.gamesave-manager.com/).

Read through the source and be aware of what is happening before running this script.
It has the capacity to delete save games, so always make backups!

### Limitations
* Only supports a single (first found) Steam User Data ID
